##Metro Areas with Most Opportunity

Description
America is known as the land of opportunity, but which metro areas offer the most opportunity when compared to others? One may assume that 
moving to the metro area with the most jobs and highest wages is the best bet. The cost of living in the areas with the highest wages may 
also be higher so it is important to calculate this in the equation. This cost of living is identified within my data as Parity Weight 
which is a scale that balances the cost of living from metro area to metro area. In the sections below, I will elaborate on the algorithm 
that was leveraged to identify the top 10 and bottom 10 metro areas to live in when considering jobs, population, wages, and cost of living. 
I will also present the list of metro areas you should move to and which ones you should avoid when looking for a job that pays well.

Limitations
The limitations of this analysis are clear when understanding that not all populous areas have people looking for work. Therefore, areas with 
a high number of retirees such as Arizona or Florida may not be represented fairly in this scoring as those areas were docked for having a low 
amount of jobs for people that live there. Future iterations of this model should incorporate a population value for people of working age to
better account for job availability. An alternative may also be to leverage unemployment rates in each metro area.
